        <br> My name is Samantha Romero. I am a first generation college student in a household of seven family members. I am also the oldest of five girls ranging from 5 years old to 16 years old. My parents have always expected the most of me, shaping me into who I am today, however, it was a challenging path. As time progressed I acknowledged different careers paths, especially during high school.  During my high school years, I was part of many extracuricualr activities. Throughout the end of my senior year in high school I began to build my professional life outside of school. This led to the beginning of my current college life.  
        Being the oldest in a Hispanic family came with a lot of pressure to be the role model for my sibilings. At times even breathing felt like it had to be perfect, otherwise disappitment would rise. All those years of being expected to not mess up caused me to be terrifed of failure. Until, one day in eighth grade I was told I would have to retake Algebra 1 becuase I did not pass the test with a require score. On this day I felt like I had failed everyone and my life felt like it was crumbling. I was embarressed to face the world, but on this day I realized that failing was completely ok. Faliures make people strong and build character. Failing taught me resiliance and got me to where I am today.
        At the beginning of high school I was determined to follow my dream in becoming a lawyer because I wanted to help my Hispanic community fight for their rights as American citizens. Even though, I knew this was a passion of mine I realized it was not the career I saw myself in the future. After, I joined the AVID program at my school I was introduced to a new career path, Business. I knew this was what I wanted to do, however, in Business there are so many different specializations that it was hard for me to choose. After, educating myself on all options I came to the conclusion that I wanted to work within the Buisness Administration field. This encoruged me to apply for an internship at the Lake Elsinore city hall where I gained experince talking to business owners and obtained leadership skills.
        At the end of my senior year I decided it was time to begin my search for a first job. I worked on my resume and had various of my teachers revise it before I submitted it. I applied at Walmart during the holiday seasons which is why I got hired relatively fast. I felt like I had begun the second part of my life. Adulting was starting to happen. I was now considered a sales floor associate working in the toy department. After, the holidays were over I was offically hired as part time. From this point on I knew I would be able to succeed in both my life inside school and outside of school. 
        The year 2020 has been full of surprises, but I have managed to keep going and always strive for the best. I'm currently in my first quarter of college and I'm working part time as Support Manager at Walmart. It has been some rough years , but the future a waits and many good things are yet to come.<br>
